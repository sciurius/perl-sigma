signatures

My personal implementation of basic subroutine and method signatures,
using source filtering.

The following transformations are implemented:

    sub foo ($x, $y) {
    sub foo {
        my ($x, $y) = @_;

    sub foo ($x, $y) :method {
    sub foo :method {
        my ($self, $x, $y) = @_;

    sub method ($x, $y) {
    sub foo :method {
        my ($self, $x, $y) = @_;

It saves me a lot of typing.
